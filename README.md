# 🚀 LeetCode Advanced Algorithms & Problem-Solving Patterns

This repository is a **comprehensive collection of advanced algorithms, problem-solving techniques, and patterns** frequently used to solve **LeetCode problems** and **competitive programming challenges**.

⚠ **Note:**  
This repository **excludes classical DSA topics** (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, basic sorting/searching, etc.) — those are covered in a separate DSA repository check here: [DSA](https://github.com/LegendTejas/DSA).

---

## 📌 Goals
- Organize **advanced and intermediate algorithms** by category.
- Provide **clean, optimized, and well-commented** code implementations.
- List **related LeetCode problems** for each algorithm/pattern.
- Serve as a **quick reference for interviews & contests**.

> **Pro Tip from Tejas Tp:** Mastery comes from recognizing *which* pattern to apply and how to *combine* them not by just knowing these algorithms
