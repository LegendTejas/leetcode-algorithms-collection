LeetCode 11: Container With Most Water
Difficulty: Medium

Concept:
---------
This is one of the most famous **Two Pointers problems**.

- You are given an array where each index represents a vertical line at that height.
- You need to find the maximum water that can be trapped between two lines.
- Brute force would compare all pairs (O(n^2)), but we can do it in O(n) using two pointers:
  - Start with the widest container (left at 0, right at n-1).
  - Calculate the area: min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left).
  - Move the pointer pointing to the smaller height inward because:
    - The area is limited by the shorter line.
    - Moving the taller line wonâ€™t help (since width decreases), but moving the smaller might give a taller line.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
